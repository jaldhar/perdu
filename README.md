Design notes
============

Lost in French is perdu as in Prousts novel ["Ã€ la recherche du temps perdu"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Search_of_Lost_Time) which is usually translated into English as "Remembrance of Things Past" but is actually "In Search of Lost Time."

[Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/) in Indiana USA is famous for its' College of Engineering.

The late [Frank Perdue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Perdue) was an American businessman whose company Perdue Farms is a major producer of chicken.  His advertising slogan "It takes a tough man to make a tender chicken" was famously 
mistranslated into Spanish as the equivalent of "It takes a virile man to make a chicken pregnant."

There is a classic Gothic novel called
 ["Melmoth the Wanderer"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melmoth_the_Wanderer).  Melmoth wanders because he has lost his soul in a bargain with the Devil.

 I shall attempt to turn all of this into a playable game.  It shall be a roguelike because I like roguelikes. 
[Update: not a roguelike.  More like GNU Robots.]

Backstory / Instructions
========================

It is 1920.  You, Marcel Proust, have been appointed Visiting Professor of French Literature at Purdue University.
To your horror you discover that underneath its' placid Midwestern exterior, the university has become the lair of
the mad scientist Professor Melmoth who is hellbent on conquering the world with his army of mutant robot chickens.
Before you can warn President Harding, you are knocked out.  You wake up in the Richard and Patricia Lawson Memorial
Death Pit with 12 chickens.  Luckily they are not very intelligent.  If you can make them run into each other or into
walls they will explode.  Kill them all and you can save the world.

Use the left and right arrow keys to turn and the up arrow key to move forward.  Pressing space will let you stand still.
(The chickens will still move.);
