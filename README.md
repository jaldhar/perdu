The late [Frank Perdue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Perdue) was an American businessman whose company Perdue Farms is a major producer of chicken.  His advertising slogan "It takes a tough man to make a tender chicken" was famously 
mistranslated into Spanish as the equivalent of "It takes a virile man to make a chicken pregnant."

There is a classic Gothic novel called
 ["Melmoth the Wanderer"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melmoth_the_Wanderer).  Melmoth wanders because he has lost his soul in a bargain with the Devil.
